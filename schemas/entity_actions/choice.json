The actions which are modified have to be of the type the field of the meta action type requires. For example, if you have a field which requires an Entity Action Type and you insert a Delay (Meta Action Type), the action type you need to provide inside that meta action type will have to be an Entity Action Type as well.\nType: 'origins:choice'\n- Executes one of the provided actions, choosing randomly based on the assigned weights.
