The actions which are modified have to be of the type the field of the meta action type requires. For example, if you have a field which requires an Entity Action Type and you insert a Delay (Meta Action Type), the action type you need to provide inside that meta action type will have to be an Entity Action Type as well.\nType: 'origins:if_else_list'\n- Checks a list of actions associated with conditions, and executes the first one in the list for which the condition holds.
