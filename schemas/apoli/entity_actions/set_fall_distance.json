Some more specific actions only have an effect on more specific entity types (e.g. Exhaust (Entity Action Type) only works on a PlayerEntity, as other entities do not have a hunger bar). These are available to power/action types that provides a entity_action object field.\nType: 'origins:set_fall_distance'\n- Sets the fall distance of the entity to the specified amount. The fall distance value keeps track of how many blocks the entity has fallen and is used to calculate the amount of fall damage the entity takes. By setting it to 0 while falling, the entity essentially takes fall damage as if it had only fallen from the current position.",
