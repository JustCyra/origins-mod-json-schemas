description: |-
  Power Types are what grants functionality to your origins! Each power has a type, specified with a type field in the JSON. Which type a power is defines which other fields it requires and supports.
  Type: 'origins:prevent_block_selection'
  - Prevents the selection (i.e. targetting) of blocks for a player. This means they are not able to mine them, and attacks, interactions, etc. will pass through the block to whatever's behind it.
